# Simple Shop - A Demo App

This App was created using React Native to fulfil the following brief for a basic shopping App:

--

Screens:

- Splash screen
- Home Screen
- Product screen
- Cart page
- Checkout process through confirmation page

Product must have:

- 2 images
- Description
- Price
- Variations with different features and prices
- Can only buy one of each variation per cart

Extra notes:

- It is allowed to have one product only as long as there are variations following the instructions above.
- Donâ€™t expect a fully fleshed UI/UX, happy to have grey scale UI and things to simplify the work, at least make sure that the user journey flows

--

_You may note the addition of the 'Order History' tab - this wasn't strictly required in the brief, but I figured it made the Home screen look a bit less lonely_

## Getting started

Note that this project was created on a device with an Apple Silicon processor, running macOS 14.0, Node 18.12.1, Xcode 15.0 and Android Studio 2022.3.1. It's been tested on a simulated iOS device running iOS 17.0, an emulated Android device running Android 13.0, and a real iPhone 15 Pro Max running iOS 17.0.3. It'll probably work with different configurations, but no guarantees!

**All of the instructions below assume you're running the above configuration.**

To get started, you'll want to follow the **React Native CLI quickstart** guide (not Expo) [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for both iOS and Android, excluding the 'Creating a new application' step. Please take note of the following additions/modifications:

1. I recommend downloading Xcode directly from [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/download/applications/) if you have a developer account. It's much easier to work with in respect to updating/managing separate versions
2. If you want to test this on a real iOS device, you'll want to run `brew install ios-deploy`
3. Install the Android Command-line tools from within the SDK Tools section of the Android Studio SDK Manager, and add `export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin` to your preferred environment configuration file (e.g. `~/.zshrc`)
4. Add `export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home"` to your preferred environment configuration file (e.g. `~/.zshrc`) (this is assuming you installed the JDK recommended in the quickstart guide above - adjust this as necessary)
5. While all of those instructions should result in a reproducible outcome, there's almost always things that go wrong due to slightly different setups on different devices. `npx react-native doctor` can help point the way if things aren't working quite right. For Android, opening Android Studio and running a gradle sync can also help.
6. This project was configured with `yarn` - it will _probably_ work with npm, just substitute any instructions that mention `yarn` with `npm` (it'll mess with the lockfile, though)

After all the project requirements have been set up, including Xcode installed and signed in, and Android Studio set up with an emulator, you can navigate to the root project directory and run the following commands to start the App and the Metro bundler:

### iOS

1. `yarn` (`npm install` if using npm)
2. `cd ios`
3. `pod install`
4. `cd ..`
5. `yarn ios` (this is configured in `package.json` to run on an iPhone 15 simulator - adjust or pass in your own arguments if necessary)

### Android

1. `yarn` (`npm install` if using npm)
2. `yarn android` (this should launch an existing emulator, or connect to a running one. Your terminal window can appear unresponsive for a bit after running it, so give it a minute or two to finish running background tasks)

You can also run the project directly from Xcode or Android Studio if you wish.

## Next steps

With the limited scope of this project, and time constraints to create it, there are a few things I would do next if I had more time or if this was turning into a real project:

- Create a proper API. Obviously all of the API interactions are mocked out in this example, and as a result some of the state management is less than ideal to support that. If a real API were available, I would probably update the product/cart state to use some kind of normalised entity model to avoid refetching product details everywhere, and to avoid all the mapping gymnastics around the cart.
- More responsive design. A lot of design elements are using percentage based widths, which work fine in the short term but don't adapt well to differing screen/font sizes. I'd like to create some more foundational layout components to make the UI more adaptable. The customer details form in particular looks quite awful.
- Tests. Right now there are no tests at all (unit or otherwise), and I'd like to create a proper test suite.
- Learn more about RTK Queries. While I was previously familiar with Redux Toolkit, this was my first time using RTK Queries. They seem quite powerful, but I wasn't sure I used them in a 100% correct way, nor did I probably leverage all the functionality they provide. I'm sure I ended up doing some things that weren't quite best practice that made things harder for myself.
- Animations. Right now a couple of buttons have some basic animations just to react to user interaction, but I would create a more robust base animation set to use across the board for interactable elements, and probably also migrate over to `react-native-reanimated`.
- Theming. A lot of the components are manually styled - I would avoid doing this once a proper design was in place, and use a theme with tokenised values to keep things consistent.
- Error handling. None of the screens really account for errors, and the customer details form especially contains no validation.
- Hire a designer. Obviously the design/UX is very barebones and utilitarian right now, but the entire design needs an overhaul.
